Portfolio Website Choices

    Font Choice
        I chose to use Montserrat as my font choice because it is an extremely easy to read font. I do not want people to struggle when reading the text on my site but I also did 
        not want an extremely "basic" text such as Arial. So, I felt Montserrat was a solid choice.
    Color Palette
        I used the Real Madrid soccer team's color palette as inspiration. I've always like their palette and felt it matches up with my personality well. I felt the gold color 
        they use is a fantastic statement color to use throughout my site.
    Icons
        The only icons I used were an email icon and a LinkedIn icon. I found both online and decided to use them because they were extremely simple and were just a basic black 
        PNG. I found this to fit perfectly with the minimalistic design I went for.
    Images
        I used multiple images throughout my site in order to add more content to it. On my index page, I have a big image of myself because as it is my website, I want to catch 
        the user's eye with an introduction of myself; a large image of myself does a good job of that. As well, I added a couple more, this time smaller, images of myself in the 
        play page. This was due to it being a page about myself and my interests outside of work and I felt showing me participating in these interests helped to further the page. 
        Finally, I used images for my case studies. They were straightforward images to provide context for what I was speaking about in the case studies. 
    Navigation Structure
        The navigation structure I chose to go with is an extremely basic navigation bar fixed to the top of the screen. I feel this helps to provide easy navigation throughout 
        the site.
    Layout
        I went with the go-to website design- a header, some content, and then a footer. You can never go wrong with this design, that is why I chose it. It keeps the site simple 
        and fluid and provides an easy to follow experience.
    CSS Functionality
        I feel I used multiple CSS techniques effectively to create this site. I used the CSS grid technique throughout the site and this helped me to create the site in a way 
        where everything fits in place well.

Final Thoughts

    I had to create a portfolio for a previous web development course and I was not a fan of the website I created. I used that experience to create a better website this time 
    around. I am extremely satisfied with this site and I will continue to improve it. One way I will improve it is through adding media queries in order to make a responsive 
    website. As well, I will be adding javascript so my website has more interactivity.
