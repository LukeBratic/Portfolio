                            <p>I was tasked with creating a portfolio website with some case studies of my work. As a future member of the User Experience career field, having a portfolio can go a long way. Many companies require a portfolio alongside the typical documents of resume and cover letter. So, I would like to create the best possible portfolio website and improve it as I further my career. In summary, this project is special because it is quite significant for my future.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div id="objective">
                        <h1 class="heading">Objective</h1>
                        <div id="objective-description">
                            <p>My role in this project was that of designer and developer. I had already designed the layouts of each page of the website, and switched my focus to developing the pages using HTML and CSS. I wanted to create these webpages in a responsive way so that it can be used easily on both cell phones and computer screens. </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>    
                    <div id="work">
                        <h1 class="heading">Work</h1>
                        <p>I knew I needed to do some research. I also knew that I needed to be able to write code that could figure out what device was being used and adjust the code accordingly. I found a few ways to do this with JavaScript but I was looking for a CSS alternative because I was more familiar with it. I researched through multiple coding websites such as Stack Overflow and Code Project but to no avail. I ultimately found what I was looking for on w3schools- CSS Media Queries.</p>
                        <h3 class="sub-heading">Findings</h3>
                        <div>
                            <p>I found that media queries check for the size of the screen that is being used. This allows me to create different code for different sized screens.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div id="work-img">
                            <img src="images/media-queries_sizes.png">
                        </div>
                    </div>   
                    <div id="end-result">
                        <h1 class="heading">End Result</h1>
                        <div>
                            <p>Through my research, I gained the ability to use a powerful CSS technique- media queries. This will allow me to create a great looking website that is responsive based off the media device used.</p>

                        <div id="end-result_grid">
                            <div>
                                <img src="images/media-queries_process.png">
                            </div>
                            <div>

                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div id="reflection">
                        <h1 class="heading">Reflection</h1>
                        <div>
                            <p>CSS media queries is not a complicated techique; however, they are very useful. It will help me to create websites that are not only more responsive but, also more accessible. This will benefit my portfolio greatly because it will make it so it easy to access on both mobile and computer, giving more users the ability to access it. I see myself using it with every webpage I create in the future so that I can produce the most responsive and accessible websites as possible.</p>
