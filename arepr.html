                            <p>AREPR is an organization created to provide a repository archiving grassroots community organizations in Puerto Rico following both natural and man-made disasters. The AREPR team consists of faculty members and researchers at Michigan State University and the University of Puerto Rico. A member of this team led one of my university courses and provided my class with the opportunity to work with AREPR. I was placed in a team with 3 others and were asked to complete an overhaul of AREPR’s web presence in roughly 45 days. As well, due to covid-19, we were forced to complete this task remotely.</p>

                            <p>This overhaul of AREPR's web presence was to take place in two parts- a website redesign and a new social media strategy. My team and I decided it would best to have the two people best with design work with the website redesign and the two best with research work with the social media strategy. I chose to work with the social media strategy side of things. My partner and I decided to do the following process to complete the social media strategy:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>An audience analysis</li>
                                <li>A review of a similar organization's social media use</li>
                                <li>A social media audit of AREPR's current social media presence</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <div id="work-description">
                            <p>We then split up the work even further in order to properly meet this 45 day deadline. I conducted the audience analysis as well as the social media audit.</p>
                            <div id="audience-analysis"> 
                                <div>
                                    <div>
                                        <h3 class="sub-heading">Audience Analysis</h3>
                                        <p>As AREPR is a Puerto Rican repository for disasters, the target audience I developed were adults of Hispanic descent with some college or more. The college portion comes from the fact many of the people researching Puerto Rican disasters are more than likely historians, writers, or researchers. So, based off of this target audience, I felt it would be best to find the best social media audiences matching that description. I chose to conduct my research on the demographics of each major social media platform through data released directly from the company or from accredited sources such as the Pew Research Center.</p>
                                        <p>Through this research, I found that Facebook and Twitter would be the two best platforms to use. </p>

                                        <h4>Findings</h4>
                                        <div id="facebook">
                                            <div>
                                                <p>Facebook has multple significant points of data that influenced my decision. Some of these were:
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>Over 60% of Hispanics in the U.S. have an account on Facebook.</li>
                                                    <li>69% of all adults in the United States have a Facebook account</li>
                                                    <li>74% users use Facebook every day.</li>
                                                    <li>Over 75% of college graduates in the U.S. use Facebook.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                </p>

                                            <div>

                                        </div>
                                    </div>

                                        <p>Twitter also had some data points in their demographics that caught my eye. These were:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>25% of Twitter's users classify as of Hispanic descent.</li>
                                            <li>Almost a quarter of all adults have a Twitter account.</li>
                                            <li>Nearly half of Twitter's users use it every day.</li>
                                            <li>51.5% of Twitter's users have at least some college.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        </p>
                                    </div> 
                                </div>

                                        <h3 class="sub-heading">Social Media Audit</h3>
                                        <p>AREPR is a fairly new organization but with how the world is now, social media is huge. So, there was a chance that they already have a little bit of a social media presence. I decided to look into this.</p>
                                    </div>
                                    <div>
                                        <h4>Findings</h4>
                                        <div id="existing-presence">
                                            <div>
                                                <p>I found that AREPR did have a small presence on Facebook. They only had a few posts with a couple dozen followers but I was able to find two points based off of what they already had. These were:
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>They were sharing articles in relation to the organization.</li>
                                                    <li>They were trying to attract clicks to the AREPR website.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                </p>
                                            </div>

                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                            <p>My partner and I then combined our findings and come up with the following social media strategy for AREPR's presence on Facebook and Twitter. As well, how to evaluate this strategy.</p>
                            <div id="end-result-grid">
                                <h3 class="sub-heading">Facebook</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>70% of posts will be about the repository and what it holds (this includes links to specific data within) and 30% will be links to news stories and updates. </li>
                                    <li>80% of the posts will be original content and the other 20% will be reposts and links. </li>
                                    <li>More than 66% of all content should transition the post viewer’s to the website and repository. </li>
                                    <li>At two intervals of the day, comments on these posts will be responded to. As well, direct messages to the page will be checked once per day.</li>

                                    <li>60% of posts will be about the repository and its content, and 40% will be news and updates. </li>
                                    <li>100% of the posts about the repository will be original and directly from the organization’s Twitter. Whereas, 75% of the news and updates content will be retweets or links. </li>
                                    <li>Throughout the day, at several times, comments on posts and direct messages will be checked in order to respond to consumers. The Twitter account will also respond to other Twitter posts they find. </li>

                                <h3 class="sub-heading">Evaluation Strategy</h3>
                                <p>We will assess our social media strategy by seeing how many likes and shares we get with each post. We will look at what our average number of likes, shares, and retweets are for both platforms and determine if we are getting fewer or more than normal. If we are getting fewer than we will know to change up our social media strategy and if we are getting more than we will know our strategy is working and we won't need to change it. We will access our strategy once a month to determine if we need to change it, improve upon it, or keep it the same.</p>

                                <p>This social media strategy was then merged with the design team's website redesign and presented to the AREPR stakeholders. They were satisfied with our deliverables and the social media strategy created by my partner and I was successful, AREPR now uses Twitter as well as Facebook.</p>

                            <p>The way my team and I split up the work in order to properly meet the 45 day deadline was extremely successful. This deadline was a challenge because we had to work remotely. It was much harder to communicate, coordinate, and work specific parts together because of this. I attribute us choosing to split up the work so that we could each work on our own time while still communicating when goals were achieved with each other as a major reason for our success. Reflection on myself in this project, I learned a ton about the demographics of different social media platforms. As well, completing a social media strategy was a fantastic way for me to learn more about them. This was my first time every completing one so I had to learn along the way but it was a great learning experience!</p>
